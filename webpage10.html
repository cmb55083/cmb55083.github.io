		<p>This page is dedicated to sharing my personal tips and tricks for pet care,and being able to appreciate animals in our local area.</p>
		<p>I want to give recogniztion to the local animal heroes,our Athens animal shelters.</p>
		<p class= "example1">The Athens Area Human Society is a non profit orginizations funded by donors.</p>
		<p class= "example1">It is most importantly a no kill institution with goals of lowering euthenization.
		<p class= "example1">Many other organizations offer to take your pets for adoption, but have a deadline for adoption, thus creating a kill date.</p>
		<p class= "example1">With a no kill instuition there is no deadline for these animals.</p>
		<p>There are several people who can help: People who adopt, people who volunteer.</p>
		<p class= "example1">Lastly the people who take their pets to a humane place, if they can't take care of their pets.</p>
		<p class= "example1">Many people think that the only way to help is by adopting. This is not always the case</p>
		<p class= "example1">In fact just being aware of the vast amount of homeless animals is a big step too take.</p>
		<p>This insitution plays a vital role within the community, and so can <span style="color:Pink">YOU</span>.</p>
		<p class= "example1">Donating, volunteering and taking in animals who are helpless and needs a good home.</p>
		<p class= "example1">Some benefits are companionship, as well as being able to say you saved them!In return later you might say <span style="color:Pink">THEY</span>saved you</p>
